Topic 1 : Demosaicing

Part I : Test BUild-in Demosaicing Algorithms in Rawpy
Folder : Difference Between Algorithms
File : Demosaic_Algorithms_Analysis.ipynb
Description : Test build-in demosaicing algorithms in rawpy using manually created images.
              The test results of using natrual images are in folders 1 to 6.
 
Part II : Hand Writing AHD demosaic algorithm
Folder : AHD Algorithm
File : image2binary.ipynb
       binary2image.ipynb
       AHD.c
Description : Use image2binary.ipynb to read raw image from .dng file and save the raw data into 		      binary file (data).
              Then use AHD.c to process raw data and save the processed data into another binary  		      file (Demosaic_Data).
              Finally use binary2image.ipynb to postprocess the data and save it in .jpg format as 		      well as the images processed using Rawpy build-in demosaicing algorithms.
